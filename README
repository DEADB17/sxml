This repository contains the sources for the SXML family of tools. I believe that
Oleg Kiselyov is directly or indirectly responsible for nearly all of this code,
aided by Kirill Lisovsky, Dmitry Lizorkin, Michael Sperber, Neil Van Dyke, and
probably others that I've forgotten.

It's a safe bet that this repository does or will contain Racket-specific code.
